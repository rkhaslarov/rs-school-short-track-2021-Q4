/**
 * Given a string s containing only digits,
 * return all possible valid IP addresses that can be obtained from s.
 * You can return them in any order.
 *
 * A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers,
 * each integer is between 0 and 255, separated by single dots and cannot have leading zeros.
 * For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses
 * and "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.
 * Your task is to check by given string inputString
 *
 * @param {String} inputString
 * @return {Array}
 *
 * @example
 * For "25525511135", the output should be ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"].
